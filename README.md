# HRFOntology
An ontology for the Holt Research Forest, accompanying data, as well as sample SPARQL queries and results.

This ontology was produced as a project for SIE 580 Ontology Engineering Theory and Practice, a course at the University of Maine (Orono). The project is not part of the Holt Research Forest and was completed without their assistance using publicly available data and information.

The project was undertaken and completed by Kingsley Wiafe-Kwakye, David Kedrowski, and Felcia Graham during the Fall 2021 semester.
